# Getting Started

## Origins

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After ejecting, I made the following changes to the build scripts:

- Restrict names of all files and folders to 8:3 for compatibility with the FAT32 file system of the ProCon.IP pool controller.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/react/index.htm] to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### deployment

Not yet automated with a script.
So far you can use any ftp client to upload the files and folders from the build folder to your ProCon.IP pool controller.
I recommend creating a folder named 'react' and uploading to that folder.

**Just to be clear: I have nothing to do with the development, sellings,
marketing or support of the pool controller unit itself. I just developed a
solution for my personal requirements and make it available to the public for free use.**
